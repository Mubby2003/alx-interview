# Unicode Transformation Format-8

## What is UTF-8?


What is UTF-8?
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a character encoding system designed to encode all possible characters in the Unicode standard. It uses one to four bytes to represent each character:

- 1 byte for characters in the ASCII range (0-127).
- 2 to 4 bytes for other characters, allowing UTF-8 to represent a wide array of characters from different languages and symbol sets.

UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, which means that any valid ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text. This makes UTF-8 very popular for web content and data exchange, as it can handle both simple and complex text efficiently.

## Brief Summary on ASCII

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is one of the oldest character encoding standards. It was developed in the 1960s to represent text in computers and other devices that use text.

- 7-bit Encoding: ASCII uses 7 bits to represent each character, allowing for 128 possible characters (0-127).

- Characters Represented: The first 32 characters (0-31) are control characters (like newline and tab). The remaining characters (32-127) represent printable characters, including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and some special symbols.

ASCII is limited in its ability to represent characters outside the English alphabet, which led to the development of more comprehensive encoding systems like UTF-8. Despite its limitations, ASCII is still widely used, particularly in legacy systems and simple text files.
